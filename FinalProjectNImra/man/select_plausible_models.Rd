\title{Plausible Model Selection with AIC and Stability Filtering}
\usage{
select_plausible_models(
  full_data_models,
  stability_df,
  delta_AIC = 2,
  tau = 0.6,
  jaccard_threshold = 0.9
)
}
\arguments{
\item{full_data_models}{List of models from multi_path_forward().}

\item{stability_df}{Tibble of stability scores from stability_resampling().}

\item{delta_AIC}{Numeric; maximum AIC difference from best model.}

\item{tau}{Numeric; minimum average stability threshold.}

\item{jaccard_threshold}{Numeric; models with Jaccard similarity >= this will be treated as duplicates (default 0.9).}
}
\value{
List of plausible and stable models.
}
\description{
Selects plausible and stable models using AIC and average stability thresholds.
Optionally removes near-duplicate models using Jaccard similarity.
